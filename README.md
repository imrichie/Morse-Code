# Morse-Code
Morse Code device built on Arduino platform
## Description
This project marks the beginning in my journey learning embedded systems and programming micro controllers. As a veteran in the NAVY working in navigation I was exposed to Morse Code and started this project to recreate a timeless device with a modern approach… In this project its programmed to display “USC” in morse code.

LED flashes the Morse code signal for a letter of the alphabet. Rather than have 26 input buttons it will only have three, each assigned to one of three letters of the alphabet. When one of the buttons is pressed, an LED will flash the Morse code signal for the corresponding letter.
## Features
* 3 push-buttons on bread board to send signals
* Dots and Dashes
* LED functions
## Lessons
* Programmed in C for microcontrollers 
* Programmed the Arduino Uno to create Morse Code tones
* Gained experience in embedded systems
* Exposure to circuit design
